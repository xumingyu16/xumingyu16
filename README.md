- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mingyu Xu.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI and I am currently working on test time training related research at ByteDance. I hope AI can become increasingly intelligent and help more and more people.
- I received my bachelor's degree in computational mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University and received my master's degree in pattern recognition from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
- I am very interested in achieving AGI and I hope as many people as possible can enjoy the benefits brought by artificial intelligence. I will start from the pretraining, working step by step towards achieving true intelligence.
- Before ChatGPT appeared, I was lost on the path of seeking intelligence. I won in some workshop competitions [8][9] and published some papers [5][6][7] to meet the graduation requirements. 
When ChatGPT appeared, I see the dawn of general artificial intelligence and joined Baichuan Intelligence then ByteDance.  I started working on large language models. I am trying to understand transformer [2][3][4] and enhancing its ability by a constant multiple [2]. In the process of exploring from retrieval ability [4] to higher-level ability[2], I increasingly feel that the basic ability of the existing transformer is seriously insufficient. Therefore, I began to seek transformers with higher expressive power, which is DeltaFormer [1]. I donâ€˜t want to introduce some kind of inductive bias, but just want to release the shackles that limit the model. After I solve the problem of the upper bound of the model architecture, I will strive to use various method to make the model reach such an upper bound.  Data, optimization and benchmarks will be my interests to achieve AGI.

- Here are some projects I have worked on:
- [1]**[Arxiv]**[Understanding Transformer from the Perspective of Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19488) Shu Zhong*, **Mingyu Xu***, Tenglong Ao*, Guang Shi. **And I really like this.** It endows the Transformer with the expressive power to break through **$$TC^0$$**.

- My MBTI is INTP and I don't really enjoy social activities, but please feel free to contact me if you have any interesting questions. Currently, my email is xumingyu16.gmail (Of course, as I am an INTP, I usually don't check my email frequentlyï¼Œ hh).
- Other hobbies include Sid Meier's Civilization VI, Hearts of Iron IV and Europa Universalis IV. These games are really fun. I used to play 500 hours per semester. And when I was a child, I liked Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI.
